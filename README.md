## 📍 Problem Statement
The occurence of depression has become very rampant in recent times.<br>
Depression is a mood disorder that causes a persistent feeling of sadness and loss of interest which can lead to a variety of emotional and physical problems.<br>
It varies in severity from mild to severe and they present with some different symptoms.<br>
What makes it more dangerous is that one might not be aware if affected by the symptoms.<br>
Music therapy is the clinical application of music to achieve specific objectives including stress reduction, mood enhancement, and self-expression. 
It is a well-known, evidence-based therapy in the medical field.
<br><br><br>


## 📍 Objective 
The aim of this project is to build an AI solution that uses machine learning algorithms to diagnose depression and classify it to the severity class,
then provide a solution with music therapy.
<br><br><br>

## 📍 Data
The dataset was in a tabular (CSV) format and was gotten from a research studies, which was subsequently cleaned and wrangled in preparation for machine learning.<br><br><br>


## 📍 Skills and Technologies

* Programming (Python, JavaScript)
* Data wrangling (Pandas, Numpy)
* Data Analysis and Visualization. (Numpy, Stat, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
* Machine/ Deep learning (Tensorflow, Scikit Learn, XGBoost)
* Backend (Flask)
* Frontend (HTML, CSS, Bootstrap)
* Cloud deployment (Render, Heroku)

## 📍 Notebook
#### This Jupyter notebook containing some exploratory analysis, model training and evaluation can be found [Here](https://github.com/Ajisco/Sami-Depression/blob/master/Jupyter_Notebook.ipynb) <br><br><br>

## 📍 App Features
1. Has a section to fill form of syptoms and data.
2. Machine learning diagnoses the depression and classifies it.
3. There is an option to pick a song genre of choice.
4. An algorithm was used to provide a song list (from Youtube music API) that connects the depression type and the music genre of choice.
5. Has a link to a site for more information.
6. Web app compatible by every device. <br><br><br>




## 📍 DEPLOYMENT 🚀

#### This app is deployed at [Render](https://render.com/)
	
#### You can access it [Here](https://sami.onrender.com/) <br><br><br>


## 📍 Limitations
1. The dataset used was not large enough and can't be said to have generalized well despite the high metric values.
2. The app starts slowly due to the free cloud service used (Render).
3. Some musics are yet to be added and app might not contain all genres of musics yet. <br><br><br>

## 📍 To improve
1. I would love to improve the dataset in size and quality.
2. I would love to add more musucs and do more research to link the other genres of music.
<br><br><br>

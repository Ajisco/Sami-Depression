## 📍 Problem Statement
Depression, a common yet serious mood disorder, can lead to various emotional and physical problems. It often goes undiagnosed and untreated, exacerbating its impact. Music therapy, a clinical and evidence-based practice, has proven effective in mood enhancement and stress reduction.

---

## 📍 Objective 
Our objective is to develop an AI solution capable of diagnosing depression from user inputs, categorizing its severity, and providing music therapy recommendations.

---

## 📍 Data
We utilized a dataset in CSV format, sourced from research studies. It was cleaned, wrangled, and prepared for use in our machine learning models.

---

## 📍 Skills and Technologies
- *Programming:* Python, JavaScript
- *Data Wrangling:* Pandas, Numpy
- *Data Analysis and Visualization:* Numpy, Stat, Seaborn, Matplotlib
- *Machine Learning / Deep Learning:* Tensorflow, Scikit Learn, XGBoost
- *Backend Development:* Flask
- *Frontend Development:* HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
- *Cloud Deployment:* Render, Heroku

## 📍 Application Structure
The application is structured as follows:
- `static/`: Contains static assets like CSS and JavaScript files.
- `templates/`: HTML templates for the web interface.
- `Jupyter_Notebook.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with data analysis and model training.
- `app.py`: Main Flask application script defining routes and logic.
- `data.csv`: Dataset used for training the machine learning model.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists all Python libraries required for the project.
- `runtime.txt`: Specifies the Python runtime version for the application.
